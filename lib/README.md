Simple library aiming to make access to the spatial service discovery as 
easy as possible. Currently verifying if it actually makes sense.


This module will very likely only run in a browser using rollup right now. 
Compatibility with other packagers and with Node on the server side is planned.


### Currently available functions are:
- getServicesAtLocation(countryCode, h3Index)
Requests services available around H3Index from the regional server for the provided 
countryCode

- function getServiceWithId(countryCode, id)
Requests service with provided id from the regional server for the provided countryCode

- function postService(countryCode, ssr, token)
Post a service to Spatial Services Discovery server of provided region

- function postSsrFile(countryCode, file, token)
Post the content of a .json file to Spatial Services Discovery server of provided region

- function validateSsr(ssr, fileName = '')
Validate the provided Spatial Services Record against the SSR json schema 


### Authentication

The spatial discovery services use auth0 for authentication. It uses the spa SDK from auth0. 
To use the authentication, create an .env file at the root of your project and add these 
values:

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN = 
AUTH0_CLIENTID = 
AUTH0_AUDIENCE = 
AUTH0_SCOPE = 
```

We use in rollup replace to replace the placeholders with the specific values during 
packaging of the browser app.


- function init()
Instantiate and initialize the auth0 object, used for login/logout and api access

- function login()
- function logout()

- getToken()
Returns the auth0 access token

- authenticated
true when client is logged in

- user
The user record from auth0


### New with this version:
- Store for authentication added
